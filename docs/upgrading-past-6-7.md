# Upgrading your Ember project past 6.7

`ember-cli@6.8.0` is the first release to publish the default app blueprint as
its own package [@ember-tooling/classic-build-app-blueprint][npm].

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ember-tooling/classic-build-app-blueprint

Starting with `ember@6.8`, creating an Ember application will use the new
Vite-based blueprint and build process.

## Moving to the new classic app blueprint

If you want to stay with the classic build process, you will need to update
`config/ember-cli-update.json` and replace the base blueprint:

          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Re-run `ember-cli-update` after that.

## Moving to Vite

Use [ember-vite-codemod][mod] to upgrade your project.
