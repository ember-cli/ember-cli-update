Ember-cli-update helps you update the bootstrapped boilerplate files for [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/) projects and addon blueprints for newer versions while trying to maintain your changes. It also facilitates codemods by fetching the list of codemods and instructions for your projects.

The 2 use cases are:
1. Updating a project's boilerplate code from an older Ember version to a newer one like 3.4.0 to 3.20.0 for example. These are called base blueprints and there are 3 types officially provided by ember-cli: `app`, `addon`, and `glimmer`.
   - This is different from the existing `ember init` command. That command tries to reset your project back to a brand new project. It removes all your changes and additions.
2. Updating boilerplate code for a blueprint from an Ember addon from an older version to a newer one. These are called custom blueprints.

Check out [the wiki guide](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update/wiki) for more details.
This is different from the existing `ember init` command. That command tries to reset your project back to a brand new project. It removes all your changes and additions.

You can run the CLI either as a global executable available to all projects or an Ember CLI command in a single project.

The CLI attempts to be a thin wrapper of [boilerplate-update](https://github.com/kellyselden/boilerplate-update).

## Installation

As a global executable:

`npm install -g ember-cli-update`

As an Ember CLI command:

`ember install ember-cli-update`

(You must commit the change to `package.json` before running the update command or else you get an error.)

## Usage

Make sure your git working directory is clean before updating.

Inside your project directory, if you installed globally run

`ember-cli-update`

or if you installed as an Ember CLI command run

`ember update`


An example output would be:

```bash
# In an ember project directory
> ember-cli-update
? Blueprint updates have been found. Which one would you like to update? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ app, current: 3.7.0, latest: 3.23.0
  ember-bootstrap, current: 2.8.0, latest: 4.5.0
  ember-cli-mirage, current: 1.1.8, latest: 2.0.0
```

You'll be prompted to update to the latest version or a specific one.

You will probably encounter merge conflicts, in which the default behavior is to let you resolve conflicts on your own. You can supply the `--resolve-conflicts` option to run your system's git merge tool if any conflicts are found.

This tool can also run codemods for you. The option `--run-codemods` will figure out what codemods apply to your current version of Ember.js, and download and run them for you.

## How does it work?
Modern Emberjs projects have [`config/ember-cli-update.json`](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update/wiki/Config-Schema) in the boilerplate template for `addon` and `app` types. This file tells this CLI what type of project is being updated and what custom blueprints from what package are installed and generated.

If this CLI is run on an older project, or the json file doesn't exist, it'll just prompt for ember-cli project boilerplate update (`addon`, `app`, or `glimmer`).

Generally, the CLI creates 2 new ember-cli projects with the current and specified versions in order to figure out the diff between the two and applies the diff to your project. It will only modify the files if there are changes between your project's version and the specified version, and it will only change the section necessary, not the entire file.

### ember-cli project (addon, app, and glimmer) boilerplate updates
When updating an ember-cli project, the CLI will create a new project (ember new) with the current version of your project and another one with the version specified.

### Custom blueprint
The CLI will create 2 new projects using the same version of the baseBlueprint (the `addon`, `app`, or `glimmer` type). For one of the projects, it will install the current version of the addon containing the desired blueprint and generate it. For the other, it will install the specified version and generate the blueprint.

## Examples

(These examples assume you are using the global command.)

To update to the latest version of Ember CLI:

```
ember-cli-update
```

To update to a certain version of Ember CLI:

```
ember-cli-update --to 3.1.0
```

To run codemods:

(This should be run after running the normal update shown above, and after you've resolved any conflicts.)

```
ember-cli-update --run-codemods
```

## Power User Guide

Let's update from Ember CLI 2.18.2 to Ember CLI 3.1.4

First, make sure you are on the latest ember-cli-update version for good measure.

```
npm install -g ember-cli-update
```

Then, run all compatible codemods against your current version. Since codemods are downloaded on the fly, they can be updated (and new ones added) without even getting a new version of ember-cli-update. Also, we may add additional codemods targeting your older version of Ember.js.

```
ember-cli-update --run-codemods
```

Assuming you are multiple versions behind of Ember CLI, you may want to update in stages. Unless you have a really simple app, updating in stages can help isolate upgrade issues.

```
ember-cli-update --to 3.0
```

Once you resolve conflicts and commit, You again want to run codemods. This is because new codemods targeting Ember.js 3.0 will now apply.

```
ember-cli-update --run-codemods
```

Now you are ready to update again. (If your final update is going to be the latest version of Ember CLI, you don't need the `--to` option.)

```
ember-cli-update --to 3.1
```

Again, after you resolve conflicts and commit, you want to run codemods because of new Ember.js 3.1 codemods.

```
ember-cli-update --run-codemods
```

And then you're done! You have a freshly updated app (or addon). As noted, you can consolidate these steps by doing a direct update, but then you may be confused if you encounter issues which version is to blame.

## Hints

Need help using `git mergetool`? Here are some starting points:

* https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool
* https://gist.github.com/karenyyng/f19ff75c60f18b4b8149

If you made a mistake during the update/conflict resolution, run these commands to undo everything and get you back to before the update:

```
git reset --hard
git clean -f
```

If you notice ".orig" files lying around after a merge and don't want that behavior, run `git config --global mergetool.keepBackup false`.

To avoid being prompted "Hit return to start merge resolution tool (vimdiff):" for every conflict, set a merge tool like `git config --global merge.tool "vimdiff"`.

If you run into an error like `error: unrecognized input`, you may need to update your git config color option like `git config --global color.ui auto`.

## Troubleshooting

If you are getting an error or unexpected results, running the command with the debug flag:

* Unix (global):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`DEBUG=ember-cli-update,boilerplate-update,git-diff-apply ember-cli-update`
* Windows (global):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`set DEBUG=ember-cli-update,boilerplate-update,git-diff-apply && ember-cli-update`
* Unix (command):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`DEBUG=ember-cli-update,boilerplate-update,git-diff-apply ember update`
* Windows (command):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`set DEBUG=ember-cli-update,boilerplate-update,git-diff-apply && ember update`

will give you more detailed logging.
