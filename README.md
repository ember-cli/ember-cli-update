Update Ember CLI Ember.js apps and addons

## Installation

As a global executable:

`npm install -g ember-cli-update`

As an Ember CLI command:

`ember install ember-cli-update`

## Usage

Inside your project directory, either run

`ember-cli-update`

for global or

`ember update`

as an Ember CLI command.

This will update your app or addon to the latest Ember CLI version. It does this by grabbing your current installed Ember CLI version and looking up the latest version, then applying a diff of the changes to your project. You will probably encounter merge conflicts, in which your system's git merge tool will run.

## Options

| Option | Description | Examples | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| --from | Use a starting version that is different than what is in your package.json | "2.8.0" "2.9.1" | |
| --to | Update to a version that isn\'t latest | "2.14.1" "~2.15" "latest" "beta" | "latest" |

## Hints

If you notice ".orig" files lying around after a merge and don't want that behavior, run `git config mergetool.keepBackup false`.

To avoid being prompted "Hit return to start merge resolution tool (vimdiff):" for every conflict, set a merge tool like `git config merge.tool "vimdiff"`.
